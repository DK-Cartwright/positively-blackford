## Compilation Tool - WP Gulp
This project is using [WP Gulp](https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp) to compile all sass and javascript. Currently, there is not javascript setup up for compilation. There is only sass files.

To install dependencies for WP Gulp, run the following commands:
```
$ npm install
```

To run WP Gulp, use the command:
```
$npm start
```
This will run the tool in the background and compile files as you work.
